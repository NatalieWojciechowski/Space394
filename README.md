Capstone Project 2012
Grubby Paw Studios

This multiplayer game was intiially created for a capstone project for a small group of 4 students, myself included. The group consisted of two programmers, and two artists over a period of aproximately 6 months. The project is in C# and built on Microsoft XNA. At the end of the working period, the game was demonstrated at a showcase to the public among other group's capstone productions. 

Our intention for choosing to work with XNA was to focus on our programming ability, rather than scripting ability that many other groups chose to do. Rather than using a large program such as Unity or working with Unreal Development Kit, we built from nearly the ground up to emphasise our potential. Though the general public might not appreciate or notice this decision, those that knew of our choice took note of the extra effort required to compete with the development environments we chose to decline.
